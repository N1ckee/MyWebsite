                <h2>I'm Nicke,</h2>   
                <p>a typical guy from Sweden who's deeply passionate about creating things, both for myself and others. My journey in the world of creation began at a young age and has remained a constant source of joy throughout my life. My interests primarily revolve around gaming and technology. If I were to choose a dream job, it would undoubtedly involve research and development (R&D), particularly working with cutting-edge and future technologies. This fascination with innovation has driven me to pursue a career that embraces the evolving landscape of technology and its limitless possibilities!</p>
